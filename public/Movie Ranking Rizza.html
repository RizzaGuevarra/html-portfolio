<h1>My Favorite Recently Watched Movies</h1>
<h2>Ranking of movies I've watched in 2024</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Graveyard of Fireflies</h3>
<p>Originally a semi-autobiographical short story by Akiyuki Nosaka written 1967, turned into an animated war drama in 1988 diirected by Isao Takahata. </p>
<p>I may probably be late in the game for this, but glad I watched it, and I hope more would. It shows the impact of war on families, specially on innocent kids.</p>
<h3>The Deliverance</h3>
<p>This is a 2024 supernatural horror film directed by Lee Daniels, and written by David Coggeshall and Elijah Bynum.</p>
<p>I was interested in this movie as this was about the family who rented the house that Zak Bagans bought and investigated in his documentary called "Demon House". Although this movie ranked poorly in most movie critics, I liked it as it reflects mostly my personal faith as an evangelical Christian, especially when she started speaking in tongues.</p>
<h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3>
<p>This is 2024 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Deadpool and Wolverine.</p>
<p>Honest opinion on this is I would put this movie in "Gore" category, but it was masked with comedy so I guess it made it less gruesome.</p>
